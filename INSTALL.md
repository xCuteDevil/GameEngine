# INSTALL GUIDE

This guide requires a computer with MS Windows 10 (or later),
MS Visual Studio 2019 (or later), and CMake 3.14 (or later).

Go the the 'ext' folder. There is a file 'install.txt'.
Copy the content of the file to clipboard.
Then open a terminal (cmd.exe) in the 'ext' folder,
paste the text to the terminal and press ENTER.
Once the command is finished you can close the terminal.

Now open Visual Studio, click on 'Open local folder', and
navigate to the folder of this install file. Wait till the
Visual Studio finishes processing the project (~3min).

The project is ready for building. A build target ending by
'(Install)' creates binaries (and data) to the 'dist' folder
in the form suitable for the submission to IS (without the
source code though).

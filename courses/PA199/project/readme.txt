Implemented extensions:

a) Extension 2 (durability of bricks)
	- black bricks have a durability of 2.
	- other bricks only have 1 durability

b) Extension 3 (powerups)
	- powerups are spawned every time a 3rd brick of the same colour is destroyed
	- Red = makes paddles smaller
	- Green = makes paddles bigger
	- Blue = slows down the ball
	- Yellow = speeds up the ball
